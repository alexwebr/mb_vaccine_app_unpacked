Unpacked MB Vaccine Card verifier app
============================

In Manitoba, Canada, we have proof-of-vaccination cards and an app for verifying them.

The app is not open source and I wanted to look at it, so this is the Android APK unpacked using `apktool`.

The app appears to be written in [Expo](https://expo.io/) framework and therefore the meat of the app is a single Javascript bundle,
[which I have unminified here](assets/app.bundle).

Goals
-----

There really are no goals with this, I just wanted to do some of the legwork for others in case they wanted to look more closely at
the app.
